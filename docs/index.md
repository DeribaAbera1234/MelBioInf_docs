# Tutorials and protocols

These tutorials have been developed by bioinformaticians at Melbourne Bioinformatics where they are regularly delivered as in-house or online workshops. They are also designed to be used for self-directed learning. Many of the training materials were developed for use on Galaxy Australia, enabling learners to easily transition from learning to doing their own data analysis.
