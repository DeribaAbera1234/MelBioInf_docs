# The Galaxy Platform  

<!-- ![Galaxy logo](media/galaxy_logo.png) -->


Galaxy is a web platform for bioinformatics analysis.

## Which Galaxy should I use?

- There are many different Galaxy servers - each one has a different web address.

- For researchers based in Australia, we recommend you use [Galaxy Australia](https://usegalaxy.org.au).

- The main worldwide Galaxy server is [https://usegalaxy.org/](https://usegalaxy.org/)

- Other Galaxy servers are listed [here](https://galaxyproject.org/public-galaxy-servers/).

- Check the policy for the server you are using so that you know how long your data will be kept.

- If you use more than one Galaxy server, you need to register and log in separately for each server. They don't talk to each other.
