# RNA-seq analysis in R

We recommend this course produced by COMBINE:

* [RNA-seq analysis in R](https://combine-australia.github.io/RNAseq-R/)

The tutorial introduces the analysis of RNA-seq count data using R. This includes reading the data into R, quality control and preprocessing, and performing differential expression analysis and gene set testing, with a focus on the limma-voom analysis workflow.
