# Command-line software development

To set up a new bioinformatics tool, we recommend that you follow best practice in software development. Many of these best-practice features are implemented in a template called "Bionitio". You can set up the template in one of many programming languages and then modify/extend your tool.

* See the README for an overview, and see the [Wiki](https://github.com/bionitio-team/bionitio/wiki) for a step-by-step guide to project setup.
