## Overview

Python has a wide range of libraries for plotting and visualising data. Many of these are excellent, but it can be hard for a newcomer to know where to start.

We will introduce the range of options available, then do hands-on visualisation exercises with some popular libraries: Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Altair. Seaborn builds on Matplotlib to easily create beautiful statistical visualisations. Altair is intended for interactive visualisation and makes it easy to create complex responsive visualisations.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this workshop you should be able to:

- be aware of the landscape of visualisation libraries
- create visualisations of data in Matplotlib, Seaborn and Altair
- know how to search the documentation for further visualisation functions

## Requirements

This workshop is designed for participants with a basic knowledge of Python. The "Data tidying with Python and Pandas" workshop is recommended as a prerequisite.

Attendees are required to bring their own laptop computers.

You should install the Anaconda Python distribution before attending:

* Go to: [https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section)
* Select your operating system
* Select the Python 3.7 (not 2.7) option to download and install. This is a large download (over 600MB). If you aren't able to install it prior to the workshop, we can work around this, but please contact us beforehand.

## Notebooks and Data

This workshop is implemented as a set of Jupyter Notebooks, and we will use (and introduce) Jupyter during the workshop.

You can find all notebooks and data in [this github repository](https://github.com/claresloggett/data_tidying_and_visualisation). For this workshop, we will use the Seaborn_Matplotlib.ipynb and Altair.ipynb notebooks.
