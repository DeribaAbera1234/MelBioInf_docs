## Introduction

<!-- Add expected time at the start of each section -->
**Expected time:** 40 minutes.

### Subsection

Sections are marked with `##`, and subsections with `###`. Higher heading levels should be avoided.

These divisions can also be used in other parts other than between sections.

---

Add keypoints at the end of each section or subsection. Keypoints use the `note` admonition.

Read more about admonitions on the [Material for MkDocs documentation](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/admonitions/).

!!! note "Keypoints"

    - Version control is like an unlimited ‘undo’.
    - Version control also allows many people to work in parallel.

!!! warning "TO-DO"
    - Add more admonitions to the template.


## Glossary

A glossary at the end of the page is always helpful. This way you can refer to [terms](./template.md#glossary) throughout the lesson.

**Terms:** are written in bold in the glossary.
